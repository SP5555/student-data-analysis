# Student Record Analysis
## Comparison between CS and non-CS performance
This data analysis examine how the CS and non-CS performance changes over time to see if temporal factors like time have a noticeable impact on the grades.
## Requirements
Install latest version of **Python** and **Git**.
## Dependencies
> Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib

## How to run
1. Have **Python** and **Git** installed in your computer.
Create a directory where you want to clone this repository.
Then, open the terminal in that directory and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SP5555/student-data-analysis.git
```
**Git** will create a local copy of the repository in a folder named `student-data-analysis`.
2. Navigate to the `student-data-analysis` folder. Then, set up the python virtual environment by running:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
3. Activate the environment (on Windows):
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```
>If environment activation does not work, change the execution policy (**temporarily for the current session**) by running the following command in the same terminal. Then try step **3** again.
```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process
```
4. Install dependencies using `pip`, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Run the program with the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```
Alternatively, you can double-click on `main.py` if your environment supports it.
